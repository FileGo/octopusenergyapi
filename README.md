# Octopus Energy API

This package provides an interface to [Octopus Energy's](https://octopus.energy/) [API](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/), which provides a lot of useful data, including viewing half-hourly consumption of an electricity or gas meter.

An API key from Octopus energy is required, as mentioned [here](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/#authentication). This can be obtained from your online dashboard.
